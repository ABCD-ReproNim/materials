**Week 2 Data Exercise**: Each week, ABCD-ReproNim students will complete a data exercise to reinforce course content while developing practical skills. This week we ask that students complete a [Data Exercise](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeVpugDXlfpG5oApIl3rfJV5Cf2lbXJy1ntYmBgpdmlT8FGng/viewform?usp=sf_link) that asks some questions about ABCD data, shell commands, and git basics. *Please complete the Week 2 Quiz after viewing the Week 2 videos.* Solutions for this week's data exercise can be found on our [GitHub](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/exercises/tree/main/week_2)

**Optional DEAP Data Exercise**: The [Week 2 Data Exercise](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeVpugDXlfpG5oApIl3rfJV5Cf2lbXJy1ntYmBgpdmlT8FGng/viewform?usp=sf_link) contains an optional set of DEAP questions that require ABCD data access. We have created a separate link to these questions [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJOjxPZwnES9OTmZHbuSX9wq81SUD6F0SRHwRIfnnXWbNlgA/viewform?usp=sf_link) for those students who do not yet have ABCD data access and want to complete the optional DEAP portion of this week's Data Exercise at a later time.

**A note on DEAP access**: If you do have an active DUC but are having trouble logging in to [DEAP](https://deap.nimhda.org/applications/User/login.php) then please [email the NDA help desk](mailto:ndahelp@mail.nih.gov) to ask for assistance. The DEAP website sometimes experiences access errors and the NDA help desk can provide assistance in resetting access.

**ABCD Data Access Confirmation**: In order to access ABCD Study data you will need to obtain a Data Use Certification (DUC) from the [NDA](https://nda.nih.gov/). We provide instructions on [how to obtain ABCD data access](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18hsT2x15bypuXFcfMQb9Ck_YEB7VvY2j4w5hwbV78A4/edit?usp=sharing) to help with this process. Once you have an approved DUC please complete our [ABCD Data Access Confirmation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZbXLB2HdciB88YN3JIXg6OdUN2dq1KnLTolIcos2Tu6FazA/viewform?usp=sf_link). Note that you do not need to have ABCD data access in order to take this course. This assignment is optional and does not count towards completion of the course. However, *students who do not successfully complete this assignment will not be allowed to participate in Project Month.*
