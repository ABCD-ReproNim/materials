**Week 3 Data Exercise**: This week we ask that students complete a [Data Exercise](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSee9-pHekPEuSHCObC9rc9AOWChbZxYZ2dMxJyQo6zvSttl7Q/viewform?usp=sf_link) that asks questions about ABCD sampling, recruitment, and retention as well as using containers and ReproEnv. This week's Data Exercise will require Docker be installed on your computer. Please [download Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and then follow the installation instructions. *Please complete the Week 3 Data Exercise after viewing the Week 3 videos.* Solutions for this week's data exercise can be found on our [GitHub](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/exercises/blob/main/week_3/week_3_year_2_quiz.md)

**ABCD Data Access Confirmation**: In order to access ABCD Study data you will need to obtain a Data Use Certification (DUC) from the [NDA](https://nda.nih.gov/). We provide instructions on [how to obtain ABCD data access](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18hsT2x15bypuXFcfMQb9Ck_YEB7VvY2j4w5hwbV78A4/edit?usp=sharing) to help with this process. Once you have an approved DUC please complete our [ABCD Data Access Confirmation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZbXLB2HdciB88YN3JIXg6OdUN2dq1KnLTolIcos2Tu6FazA/viewform?usp=sf_link). Note that you do not need to have ABCD data access in order to take this course. This assignment is optional and does not count towards completion of the course. However, *students who do not successfully complete this assignment will not be allowed to participate in Project Month.*
