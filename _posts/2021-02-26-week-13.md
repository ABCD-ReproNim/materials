It's the week before project week! We will have one last ABCD-ReproNim Q&A Session on Friday Feb 26, 2021, at 1pm EST (10am PST):
  Observer Students: Please tune in to http://webcast.fiu.edu on February 26th, 2021 at 1pm EST
  Enrolled Students: a link to join the Q&A Zoom has been emailed to you

If you plan to participate in Project Week make sure to attend this session! ABCD-ReproNim students who [proposed projects](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/projects/issues) will make pitches describing their ideas and what they hope to accomplish over Project Week. We will be asking *all* Project Week participants to join a project team for Project Week and this is your chance to see what projects are available to help with! If you cannot attend live then that's OK -- we will post a recording of the Q&A on this page after it airs.
