If you missed the final ABCD-ReproNim Q&A Session (held on Feb 26, 2021), in which our wonderful students gave pitches for each of the projects for Project Week, you can watch the reply of it here: https://www.youtube.com/embed/zTOleP0JIqo


If you plan to participate in Project Week make sure to attend this session! ABCD-ReproNim students who [proposed projects](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/projects/issues) will make pitches describing their ideas and what they hope to accomplish over Project Week. We will be asking *all* Project Week participants to join a project team for Project Week and this is your chance to see what projects are available to help with! If you cannot attend live then that's OK -- we will post a recording of the Q&A on this page after it airs.
