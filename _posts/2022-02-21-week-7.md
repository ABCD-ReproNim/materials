**Announcements**:

**Week 7 Data Exercise**: This week we ask that students complete a [Data Exercise](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSejL_piBA7bIup9f2m7h8WNoNzOKBsR7qHdHCjgWiOQ-P0kbA/viewform?usp=sf_link) that asks questions about ABCD demographic, physical, and mental health assessments and well as some ReproNim concepts regarding scientific questions and statistical issues. *Please complete the Week 7 Data Exercise after viewing the Week 7 videos.* Solutions for this week's data exercise can be found on our [GitHub](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/exercises/blob/main/week_7/week_7_year_2_quiz.md)

**ABCD Data Access Confirmation**: In order to access ABCD Study data you will need to obtain a Data Use Certification (DUC) from the [NDA](https://nda.nih.gov/). We provide instructions on [how to obtain ABCD data access](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18hsT2x15bypuXFcfMQb9Ck_YEB7VvY2j4w5hwbV78A4/edit?usp=sharing) to help with this process. Once you have an approved DUC please complete our [ABCD Data Access Confirmation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZbXLB2HdciB88YN3JIXg6OdUN2dq1KnLTolIcos2Tu6FazA/viewform?usp=sf_link). Note that you do not need to have ABCD data access in order to take this course. This assignment is optional and does not count towards completion of the course. However, *students who do not successfully complete this assignment will not be allowed to participate in Project Month.*

**ABCD-ReproNim JupyterHub Access Request**: ABCD-ReproNim students with active DUCs can access to the new [ABCD-ReproNim JupyterHub](https://abcd.repronim.org/), a cloud-based scientific computing platform that is fully accessible through an internet browser (see [this link](https://jupyter.org/hub) for details about the JupyterHub project!) [This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kXvK2c_N9TkIAYn21WfzlCPtJvxhjW13Ftf0DwnAnlg/edit?usp=sharing) introduces the [ABCD-ReproNim JupyterHub](https://abcd.repronim.org/), how to access it, and outlines some basic usage rules. Students can use the Hub to work on Data Exercises and perform ABCD data analysis projects during the course. ABCD-ReproNim staff will grant access to students with active DUCs who submit an [Access Request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefrxRzdjFak_BoxTL5bE-TnsJdg9KbGvFdOwuW7zliZ96z7g/viewform?usp=sf_link). Students *without* an active NDA Data Use Certification are invited to follow the instructions [here](https://neurostars.org/t/using-abcd-repronim-jupyterhub-container-locally-via-docker) where they can access the same computational environment locally via Docker.
