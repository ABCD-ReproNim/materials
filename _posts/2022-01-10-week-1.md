***Week 1 Assignments***:

**Pre-Course Survey**: We would like for all students to complete a [Pre-Course Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFog9Uof5SyHO3DEFstZWGBLqO-3pQm7Hiy2xHgPInSgtoJQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) so that we will have metrics with which to measure our success at the conclusion of ABCD-ReproNim. *Please complete the Pre-Course Survey before viewing the Week 1 videos.*

**Week 1 Data Exercise**: Each week, ABCD-ReproNim students will complete a data exercise to reinforce course content while developing practical skills. Week 1 of the course is an introductory week that does not include a data exercise. Instead, we ask that students complete a [short quiz](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdslts4HT4x0GSb-reBhNFL3B8KGZ-LDmTpquNmt0N7uQe4QQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to confirm that they are able to access course materials on our various platforms. Additional questions will confirm introductory knowledge of the ABCD Study and ReproNim. *Please complete the Week 1 Quiz after viewing the Week 1 videos.*

***Important Links***:

- Main [course website](https://www.abcd-repronim.org/). Weekly content will be updloaded to our [materials page](https://www.abcd-repronim.org/materials.html).
- Please take a moment to read our [ABCD-ReproNim Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XQf9aEggUlwIlft8mVGC1mdMjiJVWF4RDnnVGWKvfo8/edit#).
- If you do not have access to the ABCD data set then review our instructions on [obtaining ABCD data access](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18hsT2x15bypuXFcfMQb9Ck_YEB7VvY2j4w5hwbV78A4/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=112657771088417572612)
  To access the ABCD Data Set you will need

  1) a request to obtain an [NIMH Data Archive (NDA)](https://nda.nih.gov/) user account and
  2) a Data Access Permission Request.

  In our [data access instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18hsT2x15bypuXFcfMQb9Ck_YEB7VvY2j4w5hwbV78A4/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=112657771088417572612) we explain how to submit these requests. Your request needs to go through both University and NDA administrators, so it can take some time to be processed.

  *Please note that per NIH policy, your institution must have an active Federalwide Assurance (FWA) to be granted access to ABCD data. You can look up your institution’s FWA status [here](https://ohrp.cit.nih.gov/search/fwasearch.aspx?styp=bsc).*

  Once you have gained access to ABCD Study data, please complete our [“ABCD Data Access Confirmation” assignment](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZbXLB2HdciB88YN3JIXg6OdUN2dq1KnLTolIcos2Tu6FazA/viewform?usp=sf_link). Students who do not successfully complete this assignment will not be allowed to participate in Project Month.
