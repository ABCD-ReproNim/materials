**Pre-Course Survey**: We would like for all students to complete our [Pre-Course Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFog9Uof5SyHO3DEFstZWGBLqO-3pQm7Hiy2xHgPInSgtoJQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) so that we will have metrics with which to measure our success at the conclusion of ABCD-ReproNim. *Please complete the Pre-Course Survey before viewing the Week 1 videos.*

**Week 1 Data Exercise**: Each week, ABCD-ReproNim students will complete a data exercise to reinforce course content while developing practical skills. This week we ask that students complete a [short quiz](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdslts4HT4x0GSb-reBhNFL3B8KGZ-LDmTpquNmt0N7uQe4QQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to confirm that they are able to access course materials. This quiz also addresses topics covered in the Week 1 lecture videos. *Please complete the Week 1 Quiz after viewing the Week 1 videos.*

**ABCD Data Access Confirmation**: In order to access ABCD Study data you will need to obtain a Data Use Certification (DUC) from the [NDA](https://nda.nih.gov/). We provide instructions on [how to obtain ABCD data access](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18hsT2x15bypuXFcfMQb9Ck_YEB7VvY2j4w5hwbV78A4/edit?usp=sharing) to help with this process. Once you have an approved DUC please complete our [ABCD Data Access Confirmation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZbXLB2HdciB88YN3JIXg6OdUN2dq1KnLTolIcos2Tu6FazA/viewform?usp=sf_link). Note that you do not need to have ABCD data access in order to take this course. This assignment is optional and does not count towards completion of the course. However, *students who do not successfully complete this assignment will not be allowed to participate in Project Month.*
