We have added two quick questionnaires for Enrolled Students on the course [Canvas](https://develop.fiu.edu/courses/abcd-repronim-course-reproducible-analyses-of-abcd-data). The first is a short quiz showing you how to access ABCD-ReproNim JupyterHub (the cloud-based computational platform we use for Project Week) and the second is a one question survey about your ABCD Data Access Request status. If you are an Enrolled Student please fill both out at your earliest convenience!
