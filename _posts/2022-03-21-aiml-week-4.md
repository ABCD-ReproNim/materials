**Announcements**:

**AI/ML Course links**: Check out our [AI/ML Course syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15wiXicwJ9vKgmlaJGYoc72YrYMrPbS8F81BOtmN9vbw/edit?usp=sharing). If you haven't already, please make sure to [register](https://bit.ly/ABCD-ReproNim-Register) so we can add you to our AI/ML Course email list. [Here](https://us17.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=ae1754f263f423a3c0cc04237&id=623d5b6f3c) is an archive of information emails from previous weeks of the course. AI/ML Course materials will be updated weekly and will remain online indefinitely.

**AI/ML Week 4 Data Exercise**: This week's exercise is split into to parts corresponding to each lecture. Please complete the [AI/ML Week 4 Data Exercise on Deep Learning Exercise](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/exercises-ML/blob/main/week_4/week_4_deepLearning.ipynb) and the the [AI/ML Week 4 Data Exercise on Bayesian ML](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/exercises-ML/blob/main/week_4/week_4_bayesianML.ipynb) after viewing the Week 4 videos. Please push both parts of your code to GitHub and submit a links to your files [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfKFwwC6L2GPn7VRjCbxKJ71ejmssuAPkJgtTiwrplD_oBa_g/viewform?usp=sf_link). We do not “grade” your submissions for accuracy. Rather, we use them to determine who is participating in the course and can receive a Certificate of Completion/invitation to Project Month (April 4 - 29, 2022). Solutions for this week's data exercise can be found on our GitHub [here (Deep Learning)](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/exercises-ML/blob/main/week_4/week_4_deepLearning_solns.ipynb) and [here (Bayesian ML)](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/exercises-ML/blob/main/week_4/week_4_bayesianML_solns.ipynb).

**Project Month Schedule and Registration**: The ABCD-ReproNim Project Month (April 4-29, 2022) is right around the corner! [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_MpajolWdj3eN5vG83GnpljOO4t3Kmi7eOBPkZtXceY/edit?usp=sharing) is some information on the planned schedule of events and what to expect. ABCD-ReproNim students are invited to participate in project Month if they have an active ABCD Data Access Confirmation and have completed at least 80% of the AI/ML Course weekly Data Exercises including the Week 5 exercise on FAIRness in ML (or 70% or the Main Course Data Exercises). If you would like to take part in Project Month please fill out our [Project Month Registration Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9V3k-TF6EaQKdJ1eXC8BtOIRbJ2JPvcyrw-NFjPxYk6wAGA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

**ABCD Data Access Confirmation**: If you wish to access ABCD data you will need an active Data Use Certification (DUC) from the [NDA](https://nda.nih.gov/). We provide instructions on [how to obtain ABCD data access](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18hsT2x15bypuXFcfMQb9Ck_YEB7VvY2j4w5hwbV78A4/edit?usp=sharing) to help with this process. Once you have an approved DUC please complete our [ABCD Data Access Confirmation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZbXLB2HdciB88YN3JIXg6OdUN2dq1KnLTolIcos2Tu6FazA/viewform?usp=sf_link). Note that you do not need to have ABCD data access in order to take the AI/ML Course. This assignment is optional and does not count towards completion of the course. However, *students who do not successfully complete this assignment will not be allowed to participate in Project Month.*

**ABCD-ReproNim JupyterHub Access Request**: ABCD-ReproNim students with active DUCs can access to the new [ABCD-ReproNim JupyterHub](https://abcd.repronim.org/), a cloud-based scientific computing platform that is fully accessible through an internet browser (see [this link](https://jupyter.org/hub) for details about the JupyterHub project!) [This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kXvK2c_N9TkIAYn21WfzlCPtJvxhjW13Ftf0DwnAnlg/edit?usp=sharing) introduces the [ABCD-ReproNim JupyterHub](https://abcd.repronim.org/), how to access it, and outlines some basic usage rules. Students can use the Hub to work on Data Exercises and perform ABCD data analysis projects during the course. ABCD-ReproNim staff will grant access to students with active DUCs who submit an [Access Request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefrxRzdjFak_BoxTL5bE-TnsJdg9KbGvFdOwuW7zliZ96z7g/viewform?usp=sf_link). Students *without* an active NDA Data Use Certification are invited to follow the instructions [here](https://neurostars.org/t/using-abcd-repronim-jupyterhub-container-locally-via-docker) where they can access the same computational environment locally via Docker.
