**Announcements**:

**Welcome AI/ML Course Students**: The [AI/ML Course](https://www.abcd-repronim.org/ml.html) is a standalone course available in addition to the [Main ABCD-ReproNim Course](https://www.abcd-repronim.org/). You can find the AI/ML Course syllabus [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15wiXicwJ9vKgmlaJGYoc72YrYMrPbS8F81BOtmN9vbw/edit?usp=sharing). If you haven't already, please make sure to register [here](https://bit.ly/ABCD-ReproNim-Register) so we can add you to our AI/ML Course email list! Please note: we recommend that students first complete the Main Course before beginning the AI/ML Course. AI/ML Course materials will be updated weekly and will remain online indefinitely.

**Week 1 AI/ML Data Exercise**: Each week we will ask AI/ML Course students to complete a [Data Exercise](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/exercises-ML/blob/main/week_1/Week1%20Problems.ipynb) about the week's lectures. *Please complete the Week 1 AI/ML Data Exercise after viewing the Week 1 AI/ML videos.* Solutions for this week's data exercise can be found on our [GitHub](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/exercises-ML/blob/main/week_1/Week1%20Solutions.ipynb)

**ABCD Data Access Confirmation**: If you wish to access ABCD data you will need an active Data Use Certification (DUC) from the [NDA](https://nda.nih.gov/). We provide instructions on [how to obtain ABCD data access](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18hsT2x15bypuXFcfMQb9Ck_YEB7VvY2j4w5hwbV78A4/edit?usp=sharing) to help with this process. Once you have an approved DUC please complete our [ABCD Data Access Confirmation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZbXLB2HdciB88YN3JIXg6OdUN2dq1KnLTolIcos2Tu6FazA/viewform?usp=sf_link). Note that you do not need to have ABCD data access in order to take the AI/ML Course. This assignment is optional and does not count towards completion of the course. However, *students who do not successfully complete this assignment will not be allowed to participate in Project Month.*

**ABCD-ReproNim JupyterHub Access Request**: ABCD-ReproNim students with active DUCs can access to the new [ABCD-ReproNim JupyterHub](https://abcd.repronim.org/), a cloud-based scientific computing platform that is fully accessible through an internet browser (see [this link](https://jupyter.org/hub) for details about the JupyterHub project!) [This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kXvK2c_N9TkIAYn21WfzlCPtJvxhjW13Ftf0DwnAnlg/edit?usp=sharing) introduces the [ABCD-ReproNim JupyterHub](https://abcd.repronim.org/), how to access it, and outlines some basic usage rules. Students can use the Hub to work on Data Exercises and perform ABCD data analysis projects during the course. ABCD-ReproNim staff will grant access to students with active DUCs who submit an [Access Request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefrxRzdjFak_BoxTL5bE-TnsJdg9KbGvFdOwuW7zliZ96z7g/viewform?usp=sf_link). Students *without* an active NDA Data Use Certification are invited to follow the instructions [here](https://neurostars.org/t/using-abcd-repronim-jupyterhub-container-locally-via-docker) where they can access the same computational environment locally via Docker.
