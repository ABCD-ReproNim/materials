**Announcements**:

**Week 12 Data Exercise**: This week we ask that students complete a [Data Exercise](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmmGC7ltYFTPBA-bO2JAz119c_UcuEwTcBr3OiDtwR-HyA1A/viewform?usp=sf_link) that asks questions about longitudinal modeling and machine learning analytic methods. *Please complete the Week 12 Data Exercise after viewing the Week 12 videos.* Solutions for this week's data exercise can be found on our [GitHub](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/exercises/blob/main/week_12/week_12_year_2_quiz.md)

**Project Month Prep Data Exercise 3: hierarchical clustering of chosen ABCD 4.0 features**: In this [third and final Project Month exercise](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/exercises/blob/main/project_month_prep/clusterABCD.md) we build on a [previous exercise](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/exercises/blob/main/project_month_prep/viewABCD.md) to provide an example template for how one might read in and run an analysis using ABCD data. In this particular example we walk you through running a hierarchical clustering analysis of ABCD 4.0 data. However, our hope is that you can use this tutorial as a general guide/starting point to help you creating your own scripts and pipelines for the ABCD data analyses of your choosing (whatever that may be!) during Project Month.

**Project Month Registration**: The ABCD-ReproNim Project Month (April 4-29, 2022) starts Next Week! [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_MpajolWdj3eN5vG83GnpljOO4t3Kmi7eOBPkZtXceY/edit?usp=sharing) is information on the planned schedule of events and what to expect. ABCD-ReproNim students are invited to participate in project Month if they have an active ABCD Data Access Confirmation (DUC) and have completed at least 70% of the Main Course weekly Data Exercises (or at least 80% or the AI/ML Course Data Exercises, including the final AI/ML exercise on FAIRness in ML). **If you would like to take part in Project Month please fill out our [Project Month Registration Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9V3k-TF6EaQKdJ1eXC8BtOIRbJ2JPvcyrw-NFjPxYk6wAGA/viewform?usp=sf_link) by Friday April 1, 2022.**

**ABCD Data Access Confirmation**: In order to access ABCD Study data (and participate in Project Month!) you will need to obtain a Data Use Certification (DUC) from the [NDA](https://nda.nih.gov/). We provide instructions on [how to obtain ABCD data access](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18hsT2x15bypuXFcfMQb9Ck_YEB7VvY2j4w5hwbV78A4/edit?usp=sharing) to help with this process. Once you have an approved DUC please complete our [ABCD Data Access Confirmation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZbXLB2HdciB88YN3JIXg6OdUN2dq1KnLTolIcos2Tu6FazA/viewform?usp=sf_link). This assignment is optional and does not count towards completion of the course. However, *students who do not successfully complete this assignment will not be allowed to participate in Project Month.*

**ABCD-ReproNim JupyterHub Access Request**: ABCD-ReproNim students with active DUCs can access to the [ABCD-ReproNim JupyterHub](https://abcd.repronim.org/), a cloud-based scientific computing platform that is fully accessible through an internet browser (see [this link](https://jupyter.org/hub) for details about the JupyterHub project!) [This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kXvK2c_N9TkIAYn21WfzlCPtJvxhjW13Ftf0DwnAnlg/edit?usp=sharing) introduces the [ABCD-ReproNim JupyterHub](https://abcd.repronim.org/), how to access it, and outlines some basic usage rules. Students can use the Hub to work on Data Exercises and perform ABCD data analysis projects during the course. ABCD-ReproNim staff will grant access to students with active DUCs who submit an [Access Request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefrxRzdjFak_BoxTL5bE-TnsJdg9KbGvFdOwuW7zliZ96z7g/viewform?usp=sf_link). Students *without* an active NDA Data Use Certification are invited to follow the instructions [here](https://neurostars.org/t/using-abcd-repronim-jupyterhub-container-locally-via-docker) where they can access the same computational environment locally via Docker.

**AI/ML Course**: If you are taking the parallel [AI/ML Course](https://www.abcd-repronim.org/ml.html) you can view the videos for Week 5 [here](https://abcd-repronim.github.io/materials/aiml-week-5/).
