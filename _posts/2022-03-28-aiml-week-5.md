**Announcements**:

**Week 5 AI/ML Data Exercise**: Coming Soon!

**ABCD Data Access Confirmation**: If you wish to access ABCD data you will need an active Data Use Certification (DUC) from the [NDA](https://nda.nih.gov/). We provide instructions on [how to obtain ABCD data access](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18hsT2x15bypuXFcfMQb9Ck_YEB7VvY2j4w5hwbV78A4/edit?usp=sharing) to help with this process. Once you have an approved DUC please complete our [ABCD Data Access Confirmation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZbXLB2HdciB88YN3JIXg6OdUN2dq1KnLTolIcos2Tu6FazA/viewform?usp=sf_link). Note that you do not need to have ABCD data access in order to take the AI/ML Course. This assignment is optional and does not count towards completion of the course. However, *students who do not successfully complete this assignment will not be allowed to participate in Project Month.*

**ABCD-ReproNim JupyterHub Access Request**: ABCD-ReproNim students with active DUCs can access to the new [ABCD-ReproNim JupyterHub](https://abcd.repronim.org/), a cloud-based scientific computing platform that is fully accessible through an internet browser (see [this link](https://jupyter.org/hub) for details about the JupyterHub project!) [This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kXvK2c_N9TkIAYn21WfzlCPtJvxhjW13Ftf0DwnAnlg/edit?usp=sharing) introduces the [ABCD-ReproNim JupyterHub](https://abcd.repronim.org/), how to access it, and outlines some basic usage rules. Students can use the Hub to work on Data Exercises and perform ABCD data analysis projects during the course. ABCD-ReproNim staff will grant access to students with active DUCs who submit an [Access Request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefrxRzdjFak_BoxTL5bE-TnsJdg9KbGvFdOwuW7zliZ96z7g/viewform?usp=sf_link). Students *without* an active NDA Data Use Certification are invited to follow the instructions [here](https://neurostars.org/t/using-abcd-repronim-jupyterhub-container-locally-via-docker) where they can access the same computational environment locally via Docker.
