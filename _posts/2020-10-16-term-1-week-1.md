**Pre-Course Survey**: We would like for all students (Enrolled and Observer) to complete a Pre-Course Survey so that we will have metrics with which to measure our success at the conclusion of ABCD-ReproNim. **Please complete the Pre-Course Survey before viewing the Week 1 videos.**

**Week 1 Quiz**: Each week, ABCD-ReproNim students will complete a data exercise to reinforce course content while developing practical skills. Week 1 of the course is an introductory week that does not include a data exercise. Instead, we ask that students complete a quiz to confirm that they are able to access course materials on our various platforms. Additional questions will confirm introductory knowledge of the ABCD Study and ReproNim. **Please complete the Week 1 Quiz after viewing the Week 1 videos.**

**Enrolled Students**:

The Pre-Course Survey and Week 1 Quiz should be completed in [Canvas](https://develop.fiu.edu/courses/abcd-repronim-course-reproducible-analyses-of-abcd-data).

**Observer Students**:
