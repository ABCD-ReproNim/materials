**Announcements**:

**Week 11 Data Exercise**: This week we ask that students complete a [Data Exercise](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeJCKKsEo_LXdmfpAJ42_Tjy5E-B9ukEUhZqs55-9vdkuLvUw/viewform?usp=sf_link) that asks questions about data visualization and well as ReproPub, the re-executable paper. *Please complete the Week 11 Data Exercise after viewing the Week 11 videos.* Solutions for this week's data exercise can be found on our [GitHub](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/exercises/blob/main/week_11/week_11_year_2_quiz.md)

**Project Month Pre Data Exercise 2: Downloading the ABCD imaging data**: We are happy to release the second part of a three part series of [Project Month Prep Data Exercises](https://abcd-repronim.github.io/materials/project-month-data-exercises/) that provide step-by-step walkthroughs of how to download, inspect, visualize, and work with the ABCD 4.0 data release. The [second Project Month Prep Exercise](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/exercises/blob/main/project_month_prep/downloadMRI.md) focuses on how to download imaging data from the ABCD 4.0 Dataset. Next week we will release the last Project Month Prep Data Exercise that will focus on analyzing ABCD data using a clustering technique.

**ABCD Data Access Confirmation**: In order to access ABCD Study data you will need to obtain a Data Use Certification (DUC) from the [NDA](https://nda.nih.gov/). We provide instructions on [how to obtain ABCD data access](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18hsT2x15bypuXFcfMQb9Ck_YEB7VvY2j4w5hwbV78A4/edit?usp=sharing) to help with this process. Once you have an approved DUC please complete our [ABCD Data Access Confirmation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZbXLB2HdciB88YN3JIXg6OdUN2dq1KnLTolIcos2Tu6FazA/viewform?usp=sf_link). Note that you do not need to have ABCD data access in order to take this course. This assignment is optional and does not count towards completion of the course. However, *students who do not successfully complete this assignment will not be allowed to participate in Project Month.*

**ABCD-ReproNim JupyterHub Access Request**: ABCD-ReproNim students with active DUCs can access to the new [ABCD-ReproNim JupyterHub](https://abcd.repronim.org/), a cloud-based scientific computing platform that is fully accessible through an internet browser (see [this link](https://jupyter.org/hub) for details about the JupyterHub project!) [This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kXvK2c_N9TkIAYn21WfzlCPtJvxhjW13Ftf0DwnAnlg/edit?usp=sharing) introduces the [ABCD-ReproNim JupyterHub](https://abcd.repronim.org/), how to access it, and outlines some basic usage rules. Students can use the Hub to work on Data Exercises and perform ABCD data analysis projects during the course. ABCD-ReproNim staff will grant access to students with active DUCs who submit an [Access Request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefrxRzdjFak_BoxTL5bE-TnsJdg9KbGvFdOwuW7zliZ96z7g/viewform?usp=sf_link). Students *without* an active NDA Data Use Certification are invited to follow the instructions [here](https://neurostars.org/t/using-abcd-repronim-jupyterhub-container-locally-via-docker) where they can access the same computational environment locally via Docker.

**AI/ML Course**: If you are taking the parallel [AI/ML Course](https://www.abcd-repronim.org/ml.html) you can view the videos for Week 4 [here](https://abcd-repronim.github.io/materials/aiml-week-4/). If you would like to take the AI/ML Course then please make sure to [register](https://bit.ly/ABCD-ReproNim-Register) so we can add you to our AI/ML Course email list. Please note: we recommend that students first complete the main 12-week Course before beginning the 5-week AI/ML Course.
